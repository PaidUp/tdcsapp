The tests are written with the Mocha and Should modules and running the below command will import such.  \n\n    npm test ABAValidator\n\n## Usage ##\n\nOnce the package has been installed using `npm`, using the module is very simple.  At the moment, the module includes an `ABAValidator` object that exposes a single method, `validate`.  `validate` accepts a single string parameter that represents the routing number.\n\n#### Node.js ####\n\n```javascript\nvar aba = require(\"ABAValidator\").ABAValidator;\nvar is_valid = aba.validate(\"123123123\"); // should respond true.\n```\n\n## Using ABAValidator Client-Side ##\nIn addition to being usable as a Node.js module, the validator can also be used client-side in the user's web browser.  When you install `ABAValidator` using `npm`, instructions will appear how to install it for client-side JavaScript consumption.\n\nWhile you can copy the `aba-validation.js` file from the module's installation directory under `node_modles`, an automated script has been provided to assist you in this copy process and to make it more streamlined.  To do a client-side install, simply type the following `npm` command:\n\n    npm run-script ABAValidator client-install\n\nOnce you run that command, you'll be prompted to provide the path to which to install `aba-validation.js` for use by your client-side JavaScript.  At that point, you can reference the file in your html and JavaScript code as shown below.\n\n\n#### Html ####\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/aba-validation.js\"></script>\n```\n\n#### JavaScript ####\n\n```javascript\nvar aba = ABAValidator;\nvar is_valid = aba.validate(\"123123123\"); // should respond true.\n```\n\nBy default, the ABAValidator module places itself into the global scope in the browser.  If you would prefer to NOT have it be directly attached to the `window` object, you can add your own `namespace` at the top of the aba-validator.js file.\n\n## Contributors ##\nJames Eggers\n[Roman Shtylman](https://github.com/shtylman)\n\n## License (MIT) ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 James Eggers\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
