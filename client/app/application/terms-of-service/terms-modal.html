        <br>
        <strong>Convenience Select SelectFund Services</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Convenience Select provides a funding platform (“SelectFund”) and when Athlete posts a project, service or product (collectively, “Campaign”) on SelectFund, Team is inviting Athletes to form a contract with Team. Anyone who backs a Campaign is accepting Team’s offer, and forming that contract.
        <br>
        <br>
        Convenience Select is not a part of this contract - the contract is a direct legal agreement between Team and Athletes. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>When a Campaign is successfully funded, Team must fulfill the Campaign.</b> Once Team has done so, Team has satisfied their obligation to Athletes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the process, Team owes Athletes a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to fulfilling the Campaign. At the same time, Athletes must understand that there may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents Team from being able to fulfilling the Campaign as promised.
        <br>
        <br>
        If Team is unable to fulfill the Campaign, Team has failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, Team must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the Campaign to the best possible conclusion for Athletes. Team has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to Athletes if:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Team posts an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents Team from fulfilling the Campaign as planned;</li>
        <li>Team works diligently and in good faith to bring the Campaign to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to Athletes;</li>
        <li>Team is able to demonstrate that Team has used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to fulfill the Campaign as promised;</li>
        <li>Team has been honest, and has made no material misrepresentations in Team’s communication to Athletes; and</li>
        <li>Team offers to return any remaining funds to Athletes who have not received the Campaign services or products (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the Campaign in some alternate form.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Team is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in Team’s campaign. If Team is unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, Team may be subject to legal action by Athletes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>All payments received by Athletes and other third-party payors on Team’s behalf through the Services are non-refundable, except as otherwise approved by Convenience Select, in its sole discretion, or required by Applicable Law;</li>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>BILLING AND PAYMENT TERMS</strong><br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Convenience Select Registration Funding</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          These are the terms that apply to <b>Team:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Additional groupings of features may be added to the Service and made available to Team as a paid upgrade ("Paid Plan"). If You choose to subscribe to a Paid Plan, You shall pay fees (described below) to Convenience Select.  The Agreement will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Convenience Select will deduct our fees during Athlete’s registration payment and this is the only payment mechanism Convenience Select will accept for payment of a monthly subscription fee ("Subscription Fee") for a Paid Plan. All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Paid Plans can be paid as a monthly Subscription Fee.  Convenience Select may change prices at any time without prior notice, but will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice via the Convenience Select website and/or electronic mail.
          <br>
          <br>
          Team agrees that in the event Convenience Select is unable to collect the fees owed to Convenience Select from Athlete, Convenience Select may take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from Team and that Team will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Convenience Select in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs and attorneys' fees.
          <br>
          <br>
          These are the terms that apply to <b>Athletes:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Athletes must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data. Athletes must promptly update all Billing Data to keep their account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) and Athletes must promptly notify Convenience Select if their Payment Method is changed (for example, for loss or theft) or if Athlete becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of their name or password. If Athlete fails to provide any of the foregoing information, Athlete agrees that Convenience Select may continue charging Athlete for Team registration under their Billing Data unless Athlete has terminated their Paid Plan as set forth herein.
          <br>
          <br>
          Athlete will be charged using the credit card that they provide as part of the Billing Data and will be automatically and immediately billed on the schedule set forth by Team and presented to Athlete during the registration process. Athlete agrees that Convenience Select may charge to their credit card all amounts due and owing for their account on the schedule set forth by Team.  Convenience Select will contact Athlete via electronic mail to alert them upon each charge.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Convenience Select SelectFund Funding</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            These are the terms that apply to <b> Athletes backing a Campaign:</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Athletes are only charged if the Campaign reaches its fundraising goal. Athletes will provide their payment information when they pledge, but they won’t be charged. Athletes’ payment will only be collected if, at the time of the Campaign’s funding deadline, the Campaign has reached its fundraising goal. The exact amount Athlete pledged is the amount Convenience Select will collect. If the Campaign has not reached its fundraising goal, Athlete will not be charged, no funds will be collected, and no money will change hands.</li>
            <li>
            Athlete can change or cancel their pledge at any time before the project’s funding deadline (with one exception). Athlete can increase, decrease, or cancel their pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception. During the last 48 hours of the Campaign, Athlete cannot decrease or cancel their pledge without contacting customer support first - if that action would drop the Campaign below its funding goal. Once the Campaign has been funded, Athlete can only cancel or change their pledge by making special arrangements directly with Team.
            </li>
            <li>
            Convenience Select does not offer refunds. Responsibility for fulfilling a Campaign lies entirely with the Campaign creator. Convenience Select does not hold funds on Team’s behalf, cannot guarantee Team’s work, and does not offer refunds.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            These are the terms that apply to <b>Team creating a Campaign:</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Team can refund individual pledges if it wants. After Team’s Campaign has been funded, Team can cancel and refund an Athlete’s pledge at any time. If Team does, Team has no further obligation to that specific Athlete, and no agreement exists between Team and Athlete.</li>
            <li>
            Convenience Select will charge its fees before putting funds in your account. Convenience Select and Processor will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a Campaign.
            </li>
            <li>
            Fees are only charged on successfully funded Campaigns. Convenience Select charges 5%, in addition to any fees from our Processor.
            </li>
            <li>
            Some pledges cannot be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding Team receives.  Because some payments cannot be collected — for instance, when an Athlete’s credit card expires before funding ends, and Athletes do not provide updated information — Convenience Select cannot guarantee that the amount of funding Team receives will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.
            </li>
            <li>
            Do not assume Team will be able to immediately collect its funding; there may be a delay between the end of a successful Campaign and Team’s access to the funds. And do not take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until Team actually has the ability to withdraw it from its account and spend it.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            Convenience Select is not liable for any damages or losses related to Your use of the Services. We do not become involved in disputes between Team and Athletes, or between Athletes or Team and any third party relating to the use of the Services. Convenience Select does not oversee the performance or punctuality of Campaigns, and we do not endorse any content Team submits to the Website. When Athletes use the Services, they release Convenience Select from claims, damages, and demands of every kind - known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed - arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services. All content Athletes access through the Services is at their own risk. Athletes are solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>PAYOUT AND TRANSACTION HISTORY</strong><br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Payout and Settlement</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Convenience Select will pay out funds settling from the Processor to Team’s designated bank settlement account (“Bank Account”) it provided when establishing its account in the amounts actually received (less our Fees, as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service. The payouts will be made to this Bank Account. This Bank Account must be located at bank branch in the United States and held in the name of the business. Team is responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding its Bank Account. Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to Team’s Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when Convenience Select has received funds settling from the Processor. The actual timing of the transfers to Team’s Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule (as defined below).
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Convenience Select Registration Payout</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for Convenience Select to initiate a transfer to Team’s designated Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service (“Payout Schedule”). Once Team’s Bank Account information has been reviewed, Convenience Select will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Chargebacks, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule Team selected during registration. The settlement funds should normally be credited to Team’s Bank Account within 1-2 days of us initiating the payout. We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding Team’s Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to Team’s Bank Account or not being made available to Team. Team can contact Convenience Select to inquire about changing the timing of its Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, Team will be informed of the process and requirements for Convenience Select to review Team’s Payout Schedule.
              <br>
              <br>
              Convenience Select reserves the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to Team’s Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with Team’s use of the Service, or if required by law or court order.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Convenience Select SelectFund Payout</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              If Team’s Campaign is successfully funded, the funds are debited directly from Athlete’s cards. There is a 14 (fourteen) day window for collecting and processing pledges. Once the 14 (fourteen) day window has passed, funds will automatically be transferred directly to Team’s Bank Account.  This process will require Team to verify its identity, register its Bank Account, and verify its contact details. Please note that this process must be fully completed in order to launch Team’s Campaign.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Transaction History</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              After each payout of card settlement funds to Team’s Bank Account, Convenience Select will update information in Team’s account to reflect settlement. Information regarding Athlete’s card transactions processed and settled with the Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to You when you login to our website using your account. Convenience Select provides a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website. Except as required by law, You are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with Your account, Your Transaction History and Your use of the Service. Convenience Select is not responsible for maintaining Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent with your record retention obligations.

              <br>
              <br>
              The validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws and without reference to rules of arbitration or statutory arbitration.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for preliminary or interim equitable relief or to compel arbitration in accordance with this section, without breach of this arbitration provision.

              The failure of a Party to insist upon or to enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement, will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance. If any provision of this Agreement is judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
              <br>
