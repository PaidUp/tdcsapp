  <h4>BILLING AND PAYMENT TERMS</h4>

  <h5>PaidUp Registration Funding</h5>

  <p>These are the terms that apply to <strong>Organization:</strong></p>

  <p>Additional groupings of features may be added to the Service and made available to Organization as a paid upgrade ("Paid Plan"). If You choose to subscribe to a Paid Plan, You shall pay fees (described below) to PaidUp. The Agreement will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis.</p>

  <p>PaidUp will deduct our fees during User&rsquo;s registration payment and this is the only payment mechanism
    PaidUp will accept for payment of a monthly subscription fee ("Subscription Fee") for a Paid Plan. All currency
    references are in U.S. dollars. Paid Plans can be paid as a monthly Subscription Fee. PaidUp may change prices
    at any time without prior notice, but will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice via the PaidUp website
    and/or electronic mail.</p>

  <p>Organization agrees that in the event PaidUp is unable to collect the fees owed to PaidUp from User, PaidUp may take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such fees from Organization and that Organization will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by PaidUp in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs and attorneys' fees.</p>

  <p>These are the terms that apply to <strong>Users:</strong></p>

  <p>Users must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data. Users must promptly update all Billing Data to keep their account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) and Users must promptly notify PaidUp if their Payment Method is changed (for example, for loss or theft) or if User becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of their name or password. If User fails to provide any of the foregoing information, User agrees that PaidUp may continue charging User for Organization registration under their Billing Data unless User has terminated their Paid Plan as set forth herein.</p>

  <p>User will be charged using the credit card that they provide as part of the Billing Data and will be automatically and immediately billed on the schedule set forth by Organization and presented to User during the registration process. User agrees that PaidUp may charge to their credit card all amounts due and owing for their account on the schedule set forth by Organization. PaidUp will contact User via electronic mail to alert them upon each charge.</p>

  <h4>PAYOUT AND TRANSACTION HISTORY</h4>

  <h5>Payout and Settlement</h5>

  <p>PaidUp will pay out funds settling from the Processor to Organization&rsquo;s designated bank settlement
    account (&ldquo;Bank Account&rdquo;) it provided when establishing its account in the amounts actually received
    (less our Fees, as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service. The payouts will be made to
    this Bank Account. This Bank Account must be located at bank branch in the United States and held in the name of
    the business. Organization is responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding its Bank
    Account. Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account until the
    transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when PaidUp has received funds settling
    from the Processor. The actual timing of the transfers to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account of the settling
    funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule (as defined below).</p>

  <h5>PaidUp Registration Payout</h5>

  <p>Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for PaidUp to initiate a transfer to Organization&rsquo;s
    designated Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service (&ldquo;Payout
    Schedule&rdquo;). Once Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account information has been reviewed, PaidUp will initiate
    transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Chargebacks, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance
    with the Payout Schedule Organization selected during registration. The settlement funds should normally be
    credited to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account within 1-2 days of us initiating the payout. We are not
    responsible for any action taken by the institution holding Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account that may result in
    some or all of the funds not being credited to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account or not being made available to
    Organization. Organization can contact PaidUp to inquire about changing the timing of its Payout Schedule. Upon
    submitting a request, Organization will be informed of the process and requirements for PaidUp to review
    Organization&rsquo;s Payout Schedule.</p>

  <p>PaidUp reserves the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account
    should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or
    refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with Organization&rsquo;s use of the Service, or if required by
    law or court order.</p>

  <h5>Transaction History</h5>

  <p>After each payout of card settlement funds to Organization&rsquo;s Bank Account, PaidUp will update information
    in Organization&rsquo;s account to reflect settlement. Information regarding User&rsquo;s card transactions
    processed and settled with the Services (&ldquo;Transaction History&rdquo;) will be available to You when you
    login to our website using your account. PaidUp provides a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our
    website. Except as required by law, You are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of
    all transactions and other data associated with Your account, Your Transaction History and Your use of the
    Service. PaidUp is not responsible for maintaining Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent
    with your record retention obligations.</p>

  <h4>TERM AND TERMINATION</h4>

  <h5>Term</h5>

  <p>The Agreement is effective upon the date You agree to it (by electronically indicating acceptance) and
  continues so long as you use the Service or until terminated by You, or PaidUp.</p>

  <h5>Termination</h5>

  <p>Upon termination and closing of Your PaidUp Account, we will immediately discontinue Your
  access to the Service. You agree to complete all pending transactions and stop accepting new transactions
  through the Service. You will not be refunded the remainder of any Fees that you have paid for the Service if
  your access to or use of the Service is terminated or suspended. Any funds will be paid out to Organization
  subject to the terms of its Payout Schedule.</p>

  <p>Termination does not relieve You of Your obligations as defined in this Agreement and PaidUp may elect to continue to hold any funds deemed necessary pending resolution of any other terms or obligations defined in this Agreement, including but not limited to Chargebacks, Fees, Refunds, or other investigations or proceedings.</p>

  <p>Upon termination You agree (i) immediately cease your use of the Service, (ii) discontinue use of any PaidUp or
    other trademarks licensed under this Agreement, and (iii) immediately remove any PaidUp references and logos
    from Organization&rsquo;s site. In addition, upon termination You understand and agree that (iv) the license
    granted under this Agreement shall end, (v) we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of Your
    information and account data stored on our servers, (vi) we will not be liable to You for compensation,
    reimbursement, or damages in connection with Your use of the Service, or any termination or suspension of the
    Service or deletion of Your information or account data, and (vii) You are still liable to us for any
    Chargebacks, Fees, Refunds, or other amounts incurred by you or through your use of the Service prior to
    termination.</p>

  <h4>TAXES</h4>

  <p>It is Organization&rsquo;s responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of Organization&rsquo;s
    products and services and/or the payments Organization receives in connection with its use of the Service (&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;).
    It is solely Organization&rsquo;s responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the
    proper tax authority. PaidUp is not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate,
    collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. Organization acknowledges
    that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process and merchants to
    which we provide card payment services.</p>

  <h4>SUBCONTRACTORS</h4>

  <p>PaidUp may retain its affiliates or other third-party service providers to perform certain of its obligations
    and duties under this Agreement; provided, that while PaidUp does not guarantee the adherence of its affiliates
    and third-party service providers to the terms of this Agreement, PaidUp will be liable for the acts and
    omissions of its affiliates and third-party service providers in their performance of PaidUp&rsquo;s obligations
    and duties hereunder.</p>

  <h4>DATA</h4>

  <p>PaidUp will comply with all Applicable Law in connection with its collection, use, storage, and
  disclosure of Your and transaction information received or obtained in connection with the Services. You agree
  to provide PaidUp accurate and complete information about You and Your business as required to provide the
  Services or as otherwise required by the Processing Agreement, and You authorize PaidUp to share such
  information and transaction information with Processor as it relates to Your use of the payment processing

  third party without Your consent.</p>

  <h4>GENERAL</h4>

  <h5>Governing Law - Venue</h5>

  <p>The validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement will be
  governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws and
  without reference to rules of arbitration or statutory arbitration. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in
  connection with this Agreement will be finally settled by binding arbitration in Austin, Texas, in accordance
  with the Commercial Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association by one arbitrator appointed in
  accordance with such Commercial Rules of Arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
  entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may apply to any
  court of competent jurisdiction for preliminary or interim equitable relief or to compel arbitration in
  accordance with this section, without breach of this arbitration provision.</p>

  <h5>Independent Contractors</h5>

  <p>The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement will be
    construed to create any joint venture, partnership, franchise, or agency relationship between the Parties.
    Neither Party has the authority, without the other Party&rsquo;s prior written approval, to bind or commit the
    other Party in any way.</p>

  <h5>Assignment</h5>

  <p>You may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by
    merger, operation of law, or otherwise, without PaidUp&rsquo;s prior written consent. For the avoidance doubt,
    PaidUp may assign, sell, or transfer (whether by merger, operation of law, or otherwise) this Agreement or any
    or all of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement.</p>

  <h5>Notices</h5>

  <p>Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered

  <h5>No Waiver - Severability</h5>

  <p>The failure of a Party to insist upon or to enforce strict performance of any
    provision of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement, will not be interpreted or
    construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party&rsquo;s right to assert or rely upon any
    such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance. If any provision of this Agreement is judged by
    any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated
    to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
    enforceable.</p>

  <h5>Entire Agreement</h5>

  <p>This Agreement, together with the specifications, constitutes the entire agreement between
  the Parties relating to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
