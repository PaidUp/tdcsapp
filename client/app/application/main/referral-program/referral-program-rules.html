Convenience Select&rsquo;s decision with respect to all aspects of the Referral Program is final and binding.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><strong>Definition of an Eligible Referrer: </strong><span class="c0">To qualify as an &ldquo;Eligible Referrer: (1) you must be a legal resident of the fifty (50) United States and District of Columbia or Canada, who is 18 years of age or older, and (2) if you are an existing Convenience Select customer, your existing account(s) must be active and in good standing at the time of the referral and must remain active and in good standing for a minimum of ninety (90) days after the account for the Eligible New Customer that you referred has been activated. Existing Convenience Select customers, and former Convenience Select customers whose accounts were cancelled or terminated as of December 17, 2014, are prohibited from referring themselves. Business owners are prohibited from referring their respective business(es) and are ineligible to receive a reward.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><strong>Definition of an Eligible New Customer: </strong><span class="c0">An &ldquo;Eligible New Customer&rdquo;
    is a business that (1) is not currently, and has never previously been, a Convenience Select customer, (2) is not already registered as a Convenience Select lead in Convenience Select&rsquo;s records, (3) signs up for Convenience Select services while this Referral Program is still active, and (4) that maintains an active Convenience Select team account in good standing for at least ninety (90) days after onboarding of account in compliance with Convenience Select&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://convenienceselect.com/terms-of-service&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuMbeVQ_ZrnZ6-kcDvD7vNxKNd6Q">&nbsp;Terms of Service</a></span><span class="c0">. Former Convenience Select customers are prohibited from qualifying as an Eligible New Customer.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><strong>How to Earn Rewards:</strong><span class="c0">&nbsp;In order to be eligible to earn Rewards, you will have the option of making referrals by submitting your referrals directly to Convenience Select via email to the Eligible New Customer and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="mailto:ourteam@convenienceselect.com">&nbsp;ourteam@convenienceselect.com</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If an Eligible New Customer is referred by more than one Eligible Referrer, only the original Eligible Referrer validated by Convenience Select shall be entitled to receive the Reward.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree not to abuse the Referral Program by conduct which is detrimental to the interests of Convenience Select, including without limitation, attempting to make referrals or receive rewards in a manner inconsistent with these Rules or the intent of these Rules, attempting to earn rewards through illegitimate channels, participating in fraud, or tampering with Referral Program or its tools.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="c1"><strong>Reward Issuance:</strong><span class="c0">&nbsp; If there are options within the Program for method of Reward issuance (e.g., check or account credit), it is the sole responsibility of the Eligible Referrer to communicate the desired method of Reward issuance to Customer Care at 855-764-3232. A </span><span class="c5"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFHAkxrxyoMfPIsPr_1CyJB_PoZA">&nbsp;W-9 form</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;must be completed, submitted and approved for all Rewards prior to issuance of Reward. The W-9 form must match the name of the person or company receiving the award. If no specific election of Reward issuance method has been made, the Reward will be issued to the Eligible Referrer in the form of a check. If a valid W-9 form has not been received and approved within one hundred and eighty (180) days of Reward eligibility ninety (90) days after New Customer has activated their account), the Reward will be forfeited. In the event the Eligible Referrer&rsquo;s account has a past due balance, that balance will be deducted from the Reward. Rewards are considered taxable income and are subject to local, state and federal taxes. When the value of the reward items for which you have redeemed points reaches $600 or more in a calendar year, a 1099 tax form will be generated and mailed to you for tax reporting purposes. Convenience Select recommends that you keep all statements sent to you for your record keeping purposes.</span></p>
