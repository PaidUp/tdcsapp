                We are a team of people focused on helping to make youth sports better.
                Our CEO, a parent of three boys very involved in youth sports, personally experienced a
                lot of the administrative pain associated with youth sports and set out in 2014 to solve
                some of the challenges.  Now, we have a team of people working tirelessly to build a great
                platform and offer best-in-class service and support to youth sports organizations.

              <p>
                Convenience Select brings a thoughtful approach to payments.
                We like to think that we are trailblazers in the payments industry, but recognize there are
                plenty of ways to process payments available in the market today.  However, we believe the
                challenge that exists in youth sports is not strictly related to processing, it’s the consistency
                associated with following up after a payment is missed or when a custom payment needs to be
                structured for a parent.  We handle all of this for an organization so they can focus on recruiting
                and retaining the best athletes and coaches.  We are a complete DIFM solution!
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="What do you mean by DIFM?">
              <p>
                Think Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) and then imagine how great the exact opposite would be.
                That’s us!  We are leading the Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM”) revolution within youth sports administration
                because we believe that is what coaches, club directors and team owners are looking for.

            <accordion-group heading="What separates Convenience Select from PayPal or other payment processors?">
              <p>
                We certainly have the platform to support payment processing and reporting back to the organization.
                However, the big difference between us and PayPal is the fact that we manage the entire payments
                process for you.  Think of us as an extension of your team where we handle everything related to
                payments (or receivables for you business types:-).  All the processing, all the reconciliation
                and reporting, all the follow-up with parents, everything.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="When is the right time to transition to Convenience Select?">
              <p>
                We need to have everything set up for you prior to your first parent meeting or tryouts.
                This is really important so we can be ready to go once your parents are ready to start coming
                in to  <a href="https://convenienceselect.com">convenienceselect.com.</a> In addition, we want to be
                prepared to work quickly once your tryouts are complete and you are obtaining financial
                commitments from parents.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="What is in it for the parents?">
              <p>
                We are parents ourselves and really wanted a convenient solution to manage payments.  We find that
                51% of all organizations are still taking cash and check and we provide a solution that
                takes everything online.  Parents can make a payment via eCheck, debit or credit card
                (no cash is accepted).  We also encourage parents to communicate with us especially when they have
                a question about payments or when they need a custom payment structured for themselves.
                Parents also have a payment solution they can take with them to other youth sports clubs
                they are participating with.  Imagine how convenient it will be for parents once all youth sports
                clubs are using Convenience Select!

              <p>
                Convenience Select has a card processing fee, eCheck fee and the Convenience Select service fee.
                The card processing fee is currently 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction and is included as a part of
                every card transaction processed.  The eCheck (ACH - bank debits) fee is currently $0.25 per transactions.
                Convenience Select does not up charge on either the card processing fees and eCheck fees and pass
                our exact rate on to our customers.  As Convenience Select negotiates better rates, we will continue
                to pass those savings on to our clients.  The Convenience Select service fee is an additional
                percentage that is added to the total price of any payments flowing through our platform.
                The Convenience Select fee is 5% of any payments that flow through our platform but please
                contact sales at (512) 900-3643 for more information.

              <p>
                This is really up to you since Convenience Select supports both.  The card, eCheck and Convenience
                Select fees can be bundled with the price you want to collect (passed on to the user), absorbed by
                you or any combination.  For example, you may absorb the Convenience Select fee but pass the card
                processing fees on to users.  That's the type of flexibility we offer and can support what works
                best for your situation.

            <accordion-group heading="How do I get charged for the Convenience Select fees?">
              <p>
                The Convenience Select fees are only paid on money that flows through our system.  Therefore,
                our interests are completely aligned.  If we don't process a payment, we do not get paid.
                It is in everyone's best interest for Convenience Select to politely communicate with users to
                get them to pay.

              Convenience Select is your payments concierge.  We want to do the boring stuff for you so you can
              stay focused on growing your business.  With the payment collection service, we will setup your
              organization, your payment collection amounts and schedule on our site.  You then direct all users to
              <a href="https://www.convenienceselect.com">www.convenienceselect.com</a> where they will sign up for an account and enter their debit/credit card information
              and let Convenience Select process the payments.
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Are there any other fees for payment collections?">
              <p>
                Convenience Select gets charged 2.9% + $0.30 per credit card that's processed.
                We don't make any money on these fees and pass them along to the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's an example:
                <br><br>
                $1000 - Your Original Payment Amount<br>
                $50 - Convenience Select Payment Collection Fee (5% x $1000 = $1050)<br>
                $30.75 - Card Processing Fee ($1050 x 2.9% + $0.30)<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Option 1: You pay the Convenience Select fee (5%) and user pays the card fees (2.9% + $0.30)<br>
                $1030.75 - Charged to Users<br>
                $950 - Deposited to your bank account<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Option 2: Users pay the Convenience Select fee (5%) AND card fees (2.9% + $0.30)<br>
                $1080.75 - Charged to Users<br>
                $1000 - Deposited to your bank account<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                These are just two of the most common payment options we see but we have many other possible payment
                alternatives, so please contact sales at (512) 900-3643 for more information.  The numbers above are
                just approximations and the actual payout to your bank account will be discussed with you during the
                sales call.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="When do I get my money?">
              <p>
                Credit card payments that are successfully processed can be paid out within 2 business days.
                You have the option of getting paid on every card we process immediately (resulting in several
                deposits into your bank account) or on a monthly basis (one lump sum deposit into your bank account).
                How you wish to get paid is your choice when we setup your organization.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Who does Convenience Select use for card processing?">
              <p>
                Convenience Select partners Stripe, the best credit card processing company around.  The best way for
                Convenience Select to keep its prices low is to let Stripe handle the regulatory requirements of taking
                payments.  As a result, Stripe requires that we setup an account for you with Stripe and that only takes
                a few minutes to do so through our site.  You can always call Convenience Select to help you through it.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>

            <accordion-group heading="What happens when you can't process a card?">
              <p>
                Sometimes we cannot process a card.  This can happen because their card expired or change in address or
                sometimes due to insufficient funds.  Despite the reason, when a payment cannot be collected,
                Convenience Select contacts the parent to work with them to resolve the issue and process the payment.
                If after 3 attempts to process the payment, we still cannot do so, someone from our team will communicate
                with you what has happened and determine the best course of action.
              </p>
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Why does Convenience Select need my EIN or SSN?">
              <p>
                Part of our responsibilities involves verifying your identity and confirming the legitimacy of
                your business. Collecting this information enables us to automate parts of the registration
                process so that we can start running charges immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not use this information for any other purpose, and we take your privacy and the security of
                your data very seriously.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to make sure that parents feel confident that their money is being sent to the right team.
                Convenience Select must verify that your name or the name of your business matches the SSN or EIN.
                For this reason, you should always send us your full, legal name.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do not have a US tax ID (SSN or EIN), then we may need to verify you using a government-issued
                photo ID; please scan and send that to us via email.  This is required to help avoid criminal activity
                and money laundering.  It's important that anybody sending large quantities of money knows who they
                are paying and checks the payees against certain government watchlists (entities on this watchlist
                include terrorists, drug dealers, potentially corrupt government officials, etc).  If you're not one
                of these entities, then you have nothing to worry about.
