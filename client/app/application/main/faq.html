      <h3>Pricing FAQs</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
      <h4>How does Convenience Select pricing really work?</h4>
      The prices for the packages listed are per athlete per month.
      For example, if your season is 4 months, then each athlete pays
      4 x $15 (Gold Package) = $60 for the season.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Are you charging my team or the parents?</h4>
      This is really up to you since Convenience Select supports both.
      We could add this as a Value Added Services fee to the season dues
      we collect or you could bake that into the seasons dues.
      We have seen a lot more success with teams that bake this into
      their season cost to parents.  For example, charge $1,060
      instead of $1,000 for a 4 month season.

      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>Do I have to pay for Convenience Select in the off-season?</h4>
      No.  You only pay for the services while your season is going on.  For example,
      if your season is from February to April, you are only paying for 3 months.

      <h3>Payment Collection FAQs</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <h4>What comes with the payment collection service from Convenience Select?</h4>
      Convenience Select is your concierge.  We want to do the boring stuff for you
      so you can stay focused on coaching and growing your business.  With the payment
      collection service, we will setup your team, registration fees and collection schedule
      on our site.  You then direct all parents to <a href="https://www.convenienceselect.com">www.convenienceselect.com</a>
      where they will sign up for an account and enter their debit/credit card information and
      let Convenience Select process the payments.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>Are there any other fees for payment collections?</h4>
      Convenience Select gets charges 2.9% + $0.30 per credit card that’s processed.
      We don’t make any money on these fees and pass them along to the teams.
      For example, if you purchase a package containing Payment Collections and your season
      dues per player are $1,000, Convenience Select would send $970.70 to your bank account
      ($1,000 x 2.9% = $29 + $0.30 = $29.30 credit card processing fees).
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>How quickly do I get the money if Convenience Select collects payments for me?</h4>
      If parents pay with their credit card, you can receive your money within 48 hours.
      If parents pay with a bank account, you can receive your money within 3-6 business days.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>Who does Convenience Select use for card processing?</h4>
      Convenience Select partners with the leading credit card processing company around,
      Stripe.  The best way for Convenience Select to keep its prices low is to let Stripe
      deal with all the regulatory parts of taking payments.  As a result, Stripe requires
      that we setup an account for you with Stripe and that only takes a few minutes to do so
      through our site.  You can always call Convenience Select to help you through it.
