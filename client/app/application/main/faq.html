          <accordion-group heading="How does Convenience Select pricing really work?">
            The prices for the packages listed are per athlete per month.  For example, if your season is 4 months,
            then each athlete pays 4 x $14.99 (Diamond Play) = $59.96 for the season.
          </accordion-group>
          <accordion-group heading="Are you charging my team or the parents?">
            This is really up to you since Convenience Select supports both.  We could add this as a value added services
            fee to the season dues we collect or you could bake that into the seasons dues.
            We have seen a lot more success with teams that include this into their season cost to parents.
            For example, charge $1,059.96 instead of $1,000 for a 4 month season (Diamond Play).
          </accordion-group>
          <accordion-group heading="Do I have to pay for Convenience Select in the off-season?">
            No.  You only pay for the services while your season is going on.  For example, if your
            season is from February to April, you are only paying for 3 months.

              Convenience Select is your concierge.  We want to do the boring stuff for you so you can stay focused on
              coaching and growing your business.  With the payment collection service, we will setup your team,
              registration fees and collection schedule on our site.  You then direct all parents to
              <a href="https://www.convenienceselect.com">www.convenienceselect.com</a>where they will sign up for an account and enter their debit/credit
              card information and let Convenience Select process the payments.
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Are there any other fees for payment collections?">
              Convenience Select gets charged 2.9% + $0.30 per credit card that’s processed.
              We don’t make any money on these fees and pass them along to the teams.
              <br>
              Here's an example:
              <br><br>
              4 month season - Diamond Play<br>
              $1000 - Registration Fee<br>
              $1059.96 - Charged to Parents<br>
              <br>
              $31.04 - Stripe Card Processing Fee ($1059.96 x 2.9% + $0.30)<br>
              $59.96 - Convenience Select Payment Collection Fee<br>
              <br>
              $968.96 - Deposited to your bank account
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="When do I get my money?">
              Credit card payments that are successfully processed can be paid out within 2 business days.
              You have the option of getting paid on every card we process immediately
              (resulting in several deposits into your bank account) or on a monthly basis
              (one lump sum deposit into your bank account).  How you wish to get paid is your choice when we
              setup your organization.
            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Who does Convenience Select use for card processing?">
              Convenience Select partners Stripe, the best credit card processing company around.
              The best way for Convenience Select to keep its prices low is to let Stripe handle the regulatory
              requirements of taking payments.  As a result, Stripe requires that we setup an account for you with
              Stripe and that only takes a few minutes to do so through our site.  You can always call
              Convenience Select to help you through it.
            </accordion-group>

            <accordion-group heading="What happens when you can’t process a card?">
              Sometimes we cannot process a card.  This can happen because their card expired or change in
              address or sometimes due to insufficient funds.  Despite the reason, when a payment cannot be
              collected, Convenience Select contacts the parent to work with them to resolve the issue and process
              the payment.  If after 3 attempts to process the payment, we still cannot do so, someone from our
              team will communicate with you what has happened and determine the best course of action.
            </accordion-group>

            <accordion-group heading="Why does Convenience Select need my EIN or SSN?">
              Part of our responsibilities involves verifying your identity and confirming the legitimacy of your business.
              Collecting this information enables us to automate parts of the registration process so that
              we can start running charges immediately.
              <br>
              <br>
              We do not use this information for any other purpose, and we take your privacy and the security of
              your data very seriously.
              <br>
              <br>
              We want to make sure that parents feel confident that their money is being sent to the right team.
              Convenience Select must verify that your name or the name of your business matches the SSN or EIN. For
              this reason, you should always send us your full, legal name.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you do not have a US tax ID (SSN or EIN), then we may need to verify you using a government-issued
              photo ID; please scan and send that to us via email.  This is required to help avoid criminal activity
              and money laundering.  It’s important that anybody sending large quantities of money knows who they are
              paying and checks the payees against certain government watchlists (entities on this watchlist include
              terrorists, drug dealers, potentially corrupt government officials, etc).  If you’re not one of these
              entities, then you have nothing to worry about.
