    By clicking "Agree and Continue" and continuing with the payment process, you understand and agree that you are entering into a legally binding agreement with Positive Baseball Development Inc. (“PBD”) and agree to pay PBD in the amount of $1,800 for the Austin Boom Spring 2015 baseball season. This regular season will start late January 2015 and continue through July 2015. <br>
      <br>
      If your player gets injured or decides to leave the program – you are still responsible for fulfilling your financial commitment to PBD. In the event of injury, we will try everything we can to find a replacement player.
