      <p>Your personal
        information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have
        special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all

        account name, your athlete&rsquo;s name, the teams you have participated in and the SelectFund campaigns you
        have backed. Whenever your account name or your athlete&rsquo;s name appears on PaidUp (for instance, when you
        post comments, send messages, or back campaigns), people can click your account name to see your profile. The
        profile is not searchable on PaidUp or via search engines like Google. Your profile may only be viewed within
        the context of the team you are participating in.</p>
