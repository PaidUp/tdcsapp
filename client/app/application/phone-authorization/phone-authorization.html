      Receipt of cellular phone calls (including text messages) may be subject to service provider charges. If you have listed a cell phone number above or provide an updated cell phone number, then you authorize PaidUp to call (including sending SMS text messages) using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded message to your cell phone number to provide account information and services regarding your PaidUp loan. PaidUp may follow up in order to assist you with completion of your application, address any technical problems associated in completing your application, notification of transaction approval, payment reminders and collection efforts. If you do not want to receive calls (including SMS text messages) about your transaction you can unsubscribe by sending an email to support@getpaidup.com with the subject line "STOP Transaction Calls" or by calling a customer service representative at 512-221-8006.
